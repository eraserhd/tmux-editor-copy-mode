tmux-editor-copy-mode
=====================

:experimental:

Configuration
-------------

`@editor_copy_mode_type` overrides the editor type.  If this is not set, the
plugin tries to autodetect the editor type from `$EDITOR` by removing the path
from the first word.  e.g. if `$EDITOR` is set to
`/usr/local/bin/kak -e 'foo'`, the editor type will be detected as `kak`.

The only editor type with special support is `kak`, although you can add more
in https://github.com/eraserhd/tmux-editor-copy-mode/blob/develop/scripts/editors.sh[`editors.sh`].
If the editor type is not recognized, the plugin will try to use sane
defaults.

`@editor_copy_mode_keys` is a whitespace-separated list of keys to map to the
new copy mode.  If a key is in the form `KEY_TABLE:KEY`, `KEY` is mapped in
`KEY_TABLE` instead of the default key table.
